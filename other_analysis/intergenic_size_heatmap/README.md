### intergenic size heatmap

Snakefile to determine the intergenic regions of all genes and make a heatmap plot of the 5' and 3' intergenic size. The plot is intended to verify if the organism presents a genome with a two-speed mode of evolution, in which candidate effectors are located within repeat-rich, gene sparse regions. Input is a GFF in the `data/` directory.
