### Genome overview

R script that makes a plot with the chromsomes and tracks showing gene and repeat content. Legends are in individual files. Gene and repeat content are in the files `chr_windows_gene_count.txt` and `chr_windows_repeats.txt`. The script will read those and `chr_size.txt` to make the plot. No additional library is needed:

```shell
Rscript plot_chr
```
